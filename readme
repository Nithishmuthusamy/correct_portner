Before we get into the program,I have to say one Indian culture,that man have full right to marry either his father's sister's daughter or his mother's brother's daughter
and the woman have the full rights to marry either her father's sister's son or mother's brother's son.
Yes, this program is to tell his or her rightfull partner.We are going to get name,gender,father's name,mother's name.By using this data we are going to tell rightfull
partner of the person.I have developed a code for only unique name but that doesnot matter we can rectify that by getting extra data like id_number
